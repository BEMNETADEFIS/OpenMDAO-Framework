This is a partial port of a ModelCenter simulation set up by
Karl Geiselhart (LaRC).  The NPSS models are based on work by Justin Gray (GRC).
A lot of this is still broken due to limitations of the current NPSScomponent.

To run: python model.py

Output from the various NPSS instances is routed to NPSS.out in separate
directories.

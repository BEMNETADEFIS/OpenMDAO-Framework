This directory is intended to contain source to be packaged into 
python eggs that are releasable separately from OpenMDAO.  These eggs
may or may not depend upon OpenMDAO.  Eggs that have not yet been approved
to be part of openmdao.lib can live here, as long as they are license
compatible with NOSA, i.e., no GPL or proprietary code should be placed 
here.

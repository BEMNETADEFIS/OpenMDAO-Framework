Standard for Coding Docstrings
==============================

A documentation string (docstring) is a string that describes a module, function, class, or method
definition. NumPy, SciPy, and SciKits already follow a common convention for docstrings that
provides consistency. Since an excellent standard already exists, the OpenMDAO project is taking
advantage of it. 

Please refer to NumPy's `Docstring Standard <http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/wiki/CodingStyleGuidelines#docstring-standard>`_ when coding docstrings.

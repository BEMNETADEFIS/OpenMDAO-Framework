-----------------

This section provides a brief outline of some of our requirements and the
general approaches we intend to use in order to meet them.


**Flexibility**
    - Component Architecture (Zope's or similar)
        - Adaptor design pattern
    - Virtual Python Environments
    - Support multiple IPC protocols by using Twisted_
    
.. _Twisted : http://twistedmatrix.com/trac

**Ease of extensibility**
    - Component Publishing

**Portability**
    - use of Python/wxPython

**100% open source infrastructure**
    - Python's many open source libraries

**Location transparency**
    - Abstract Factory design pattern
    - RPyC or similar
    - proxy objects

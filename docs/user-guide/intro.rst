This User Guide is applicable for OpenMDAO V0.01 or later. 

OpenMDAO is the next generation open source (OS) Multidisciplinary Analysis and
Optimization (MDAO) framework that is being developed under NASA's Fundamental
Aeronautics Program (FAP) Subsonic Fixed Wing Project. It is a framework for
providing systematic processes and an intelligent computational environment for
managing multidisciplinary variable-fidelity tools that will enable system
analysis and optimization at primarily the conceptual and preliminary design
stages for all flight regimes of conventional and unconventional vehicle
classes. The framework will comply with established standards, be compatible
with state-of-the-art computing architectures, support distributed heterogeneous
platforms,and reduce overall setup and runtime.

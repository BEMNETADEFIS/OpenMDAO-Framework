Insert into these subdirectories image files for use in the corresponding documents
that are NOT generated from .dia files.  These files will then be version controlled here.
The files in this directory which are actually referred to in various docs will be copied 
over to the _build/html/_images folder at make html time,
where they will be intermingled with dia-generated pngs.

Installation Guide
==================

There are currently two ways to install OpenMDAO on your system. They are
installation from source and installation from a *bundle*. Both are based on
zc.buildout, so they both result in an installation of OpenMDAO and its
dependent packages that should not interfere with the system level python
install. It is **not** recommended that you use ``easy_install`` to install
OpenMDAO into the system level python packages directory, because OpenMDAO has
a fairly large number of dependencies and doing so would likely cause version
conflicts with existing packages.

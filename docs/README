To create the documentation, type "make html" at the prompt.  This will run a Sphinx build that will generate a directory called _build, which contains the html pages generated by Sphinx.

To test changes, type "make clean" to remove all of the _build files and generated_images folder  and regenerate everything anew before your next "make html."

NOTES:
Any .dia files placed within the diagrams/ directory will be converted into .png files, resized,  and placed in the generated_images folder.  .dia files should be version controlled.

Any "static" .png files (i.e. not generated) should placed within the appropriate images/"document" sub-directories.  These static images should be version controlled.

Sphinx will take care of copying any of the images that are used in any of the documents to the _build/html/_images directory.
